    "# AUC and ROC\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of our accuracy scores thus far probably seem pretty impressive; an 80% accuracy seems pretty darn good on first try! What we have to keep in mind is that when predicting a binary classification, we are bound to be right sometimes, even just by guessing. For example, I should be roughly 50% accurate in guessing whether or not a coin lands on heads. This also can lead to issues tuning models down the road. If you have a skewed datasets with rare events (such as a disease or winning the lottery) where there is only 2 positive cases in 1000, then even a trivial algorithm that classifies everything as 'not a member' will achieve an accuracy of 99.8% (998 out of 1000 times it was correct). So remember that an 80% accuracy must be taken into a larger context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, another way to analyze classification errors is with AUC, which stands for 'area under curve'. \n",
    "\n",
    "What curve you ask? The Receiver Operater Curve (ROC Curve) which illustrates the false positive against false negative rate of our classifier. When training a classifier, we are hoping the ROC curve will hug the upper left corner of our graph. A classifier with 50-50 accuracy is deemed 'worthless'; this is no better then random guessing, as in the case of a coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/roc_comp.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve gives us a graph of the tradeoff between this false positive and true positive rate. The AUC, or area under the curve, gives us a singular metric to compare these. An AUC of 1 being a perfect classifier, and an AUC of .5 being that which has a precision of 50%."

    "Another perspective to help understand the ROC curve is to think about the underlying model fueling our classification algorithm.

    "\n",
    "Here we see the majority of the two classes probabilities land at around .25 or .75. If we alter the cutoff point, we can sacrifice precision, increasing the false positive rate in order to also increase the true positive rate, or vice versa. Imagine here green is the positive case 1 (in this case heart disease) and red the negative case 0. Shifting the decision boundary to the left from 0.5 will result in capturing more of the positive (1) cases. At the same time, we will also pick up some false negatives, those red cases at the far right of the negative (0) case distribution.\n",
